# CatchTheBalls

This is a simple Angular game where the player controls a character (rectangle) to catch falling balls. The game is built using Angular and RxJS to handle game logic and state updates.

## Game Instructions
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player character.
- Catch as many balls as you can before the time runs out!
- Configure the game settings before starting:

Falling Speed
Falling Frequency
Player Speed
Game Time

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/Gugo888/catch-the-balls.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd catch-the-balls

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
